            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a mechanical engineer with over 15 years of experience designing and delivering complex hardware systems. My background spans aerospace, robotics, electrochemistry, and medical devices. I have led multidisciplinary engineering teams, driven projects from concept to deployment, and built a track record of solving hard problems through first-principles thinking and hands-on execution.</p>
            <p>My experience includes:<br>
                - Design, non-linear FEA, and production delivery of a cryogenic pressurized structure<br>
                - Design, analyses, and delivery of a stage separation mechanism<br>
                - Design, analyses, and prototyping of a two-speed gearbox with only one actuator<br>
                - Technical Lead for the upper stage systems of a low Earth orbit launch vehicle (design, qualification, flight support and delivery to orbit)<br>
                - Engineering manager for cross-functional teams (up to 12 total reports)<br>
