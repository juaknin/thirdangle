            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a mechanical engineer with over 15 years of experience designing and delivering complex hardware systems. My background spans aerospace, robotics, electrochemistry, and medical devices. I have led multidisciplinary engineering teams, driven projects from concept to deployment, and built a track record of solving hard problems through first-principles thinking and hands-on execution.</p>
            <p>My experience includes:
                - Technical Lead for the upper stage systems of a low earth orbit launch vehicle
                - Design, non-linear FEA, and production delivery of a cryogenic pressurized structure
                - Design, analyses, and delivery of a stage separation mechanism
                - Design, analyses, and prototyping of a two speed gearbox with only one actuator
                - Engineering manager for cross-functional teams (up to 12 total reports)
